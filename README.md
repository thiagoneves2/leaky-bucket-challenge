# leaky-bucket-challenge
The **Leaky Bucket** is a traffic shaping algorithm that controls the flow of data by using a fixed-rate output, similar to water leaking from a bucket with a small hole at the bottom. Incoming data is placed into a queue (the “bucket”), and it is transmitted at a constant rate, regardless of how fast it arrives. If the bucket becomes full, excess data is discarded. This ensures a smooth output rate, prevents network congestion, and limits burst traffic.
